When I began my Data Analysis journey, I was progressing well in learning the the syntax for SQL. Unfortunately, I was grappling with searching for viable projects
to practice the SQL code I was studying. It was befuddling for me in the beginning seeking those projects and case studies to practice my abilities. Luckily,
I stumbled upon DataCamp and through this site, I was schooling myself on SQL syntax once more and it provided projects for myself to work on what I was learning.

On these projects, DataCamp was able to provide the datasets necessary and I answered each question to look for the results they were requesting in
each project.

The following are the projects I worked on so far. Each project is a separate Junyper Notebook from DataCamp:

- Analyzing International Debt Statistics: 
I was writing queries using intermediate SQL syntax (filtering data, aggregate functions, sorting data, grouping data) to answer interesting questions based on data
from The World Bank. The questions were analyzing different statistics based on the debt of countries.

- Analyzinf Students' Mental Health: 
Using the same skills as the Analzying International Debt Statistics project, I answered questions studying the data on students and their mental health.

- When Was the Golden Age of Video Games?: 
After learning about JOINs in SQL, I determined the golden age of video games by analyzing user and critic reviews. Along with sales data, I decisively discovered what was
the best time for video games

Over time, each project or case study will develop my SQL skills and help to progress my SQL knowledge on my Data Analytics journey.
